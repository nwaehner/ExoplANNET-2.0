Installation
============

The ``pygpr`` package is provided in the Python Package Index (pypi). You can therefore easily get it using ``pip``::

  pip install pygpr

You can also clone the latest version of the pygpr package from a github repository (and maybe contribute to it!)::

    git clone https://github.com/exord/pygpr pygpr

This should create a new directory named pygpr. Make sure to add it to your PYTHONPATH.

To get a stable realease (e.g. v1.0), you can do::

    git clone --branch v1.0 https://github.com/exord/pygpr pygpr
